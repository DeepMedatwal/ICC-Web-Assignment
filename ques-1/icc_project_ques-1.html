              <h1>London</h1>
              <p>
                Big Ben is the nickname for the Great Bell of the striking clock
                at the north end of the Palace of Westminster in London,
                England,[1] and the name is frequently extended to refer also to
                the clock and the clock tower.[2] The official name of the tower
                in which Big Ben is located was originally the Clock Tower, but
                it was renamed Elizabeth Tower in 2012 to mark the Diamond
                Jubilee of Elizabeth II. The South Bank is an entertainment and
                commercial district in central London, next to the River Thames
                opposite the City of Westminster. It forms a narrow strip of
                riverside land within the London Borough of Lambeth (where it
                adjoins Albert Embankment) and the London Borough of Southwark,
                (where it adjoins Bankside). As such, the South Bank may be
                regarded as somewhat akin to the riverside part of an area known
                previously as Lambeth Marsh and North Lambeth.

              <h1>Los Angeles</h1>
              <p>
                Los Angeles (US: /lɔːs ˈændʒələs/ (listen) lawss AN-jəl-əs;[a]
                Spanish: Los Ángeles [los ˈaŋxeles], lit. 'The Angels'), often
                referred to by its initials L.A.,[15] is a major city in the
                U.S. state of California. With a 2020 population of
                3,898,747,[10] it is the largest city in the state, as well as
                the second-largest city in the United States following New York
                City. Los Angeles is known for its Mediterranean climate, ethnic
                and cultural diversity, Hollywood film industry, and sprawling
                metropolitan area.

              <h1>Australia</h1>
              <p>
                The Great Ocean Road is an Australian National Heritage listed
                240-kilometre (150 mi) stretch of road along the south-eastern
                coast of Australia between the Victorian cities of Torquay and
                Allansford. Built by returned soldiers between 1919 and 1932 and
                dedicated to soldiers killed during World War I, the road is the
                world's largest war memorial. Winding through varying terrain
                along the coast and providing access to several prominent
                landmarks, including the Twelve Apostles limestone stack
                formations, the road is an important tourist attraction in the
                region. In December 2020, legislation went into effect to
                legally protect the Great Ocean Road – called the “Great Ocean
                Road Environs Protection Act 2020”.[2]

              <h1>Greece</h1>
              <p>
                Zakynthos is a separate regional unit of the Ionian Islands
                region, and its only municipality. It covers an area of 405.55
                km2 (156.6 sq mi)[3] and its coastline is roughly 123 km (76 mi)
                in length. The name, like all similar names ending in -nthos, is
                pre-Mycenaean or Pelasgian in origin. In Greek mythology the
                island was said to be named after Zakynthos, the son of the
                legendary Arcadian chief Dardanus. Zakynthos is a tourist
                destination,[4] with an international airport served by charter
                flights from northern Europe. The island's nickname is "the
                Flower of the Levant", bestowed upon it by the Venetians who
                were in possession of Zakynthos from 1484 to 1797

              <h1>Antarctica</h1>
              <p>
                An aurora[a] (plural: auroras or aurorae[b]), also commonly
                known as the polar lights,[c] is a natural light display in
                Earth's sky, predominantly seen in high-latitude regions (around
                the Arctic and Antarctic). Auroras display dynamic patterns of
                brilliant lights that appear as curtains, rays, spirals, or
                dynamic flickers covering the entire sky.[3] Auroras are the
                result of disturbances in the magnetosphere caused by the solar
                wind. Major disturbances result from enhancements in the speed
                of the solar wind from coronal holes and coronal mass ejections.
                These disturbances alter the trajectories of charged particles
                in the magnetospheric plasma.
